-These are the features we are using/want to use for out heading detection model

**Dynamic font thresholding:** Avoids absolute font size bias

**POS-based features:** Boosts accuracy, especially in noisy/mixed-language text

**SMOTE class balancing:** Handles rare heading labels
**Feature selection (RFECV) :** Trims unnecessary features, improves generalization
**ROC & AUC evaluation :** Better metrics for heading detection tasks
